When you want to send a scanned file
Directly from the printer but it pops up the error “network not connected”

Just try to change the DNS server from Automatic to Manual and set an alternative DNS like OpenDNS address
208.67.220.220

Leaving the main address as your router one

Then it should work 
Another workaround is to change even the main DNS address with an OpenDNS
