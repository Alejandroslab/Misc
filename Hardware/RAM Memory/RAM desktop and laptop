RAM for desktop are usually DIMM (Dual In-Line Memory Module )
while for laptops are SODIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module )

SODIMMs are roughly half the size of regular DIMMs in computers. 
SODIMMs became a replacement for DIMMs as it would be difficult to fit in a desktop memory module in a compact machine. 

Desktop RAM is physically larger than Laptop RAM. DDR4 Memory modules used in modern PCs contain 240 pins, while memory modules in laptops house 204 pins. A desktop RAM module’s average length is about 4.5 inches, and a laptop memory module’s average length is around 3 inches.

Hence, the size difference is basically the physical length and the pin configuration. Laptop RAM modules are roughly 50% of desktop RAM modules. 

 Both of them are different and incompatible with each other’s respective motherboards.
