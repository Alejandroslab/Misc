the new supported format by amazon is the .epub and not the .mobi one 

you can literally email files to your Kindle devices. Just a note, before you do this make sure you’ve downloaded the Kindle app on whatever hardware you’d like to send your ebooks tto.

Once you’ve done this, head here on Amazon’s website (the “Manage Your Content And Devices” part of the site). Then, click preferences on the menu at the top:

Make a note of the specific devices you want to send the ebook to.
Underneath this specific part there’s an option to add the email you’ll send the the ebooks or documents from.  add your email

in the same “Preferences” section look for this menu: whispersync setting and turn on!

 open a new email on the account you added to the approved list. Then, put in the email addresses associated with your preferred Kindle devices (say, a Paperwhite and your Android device). Finally, attach the file to the email and hit send!
 
 remember you can also send directly from Calibre but you must add the sender email under the Preferences in amazon
