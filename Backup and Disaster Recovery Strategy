Backup is made of:

Snapshots
Backups
____

First:

Categorize Data in order of importance

1. Top priorty
2. Middle Priority
3. Low Priority

The top priority will be the most secured Once

Plan snapshots and retain them for at least 6 days

Snapshots are sort of backups but internal on the same disk.
They can help in those circumstances in which a folder/file are
deleted without intention.

With snapshot in place you will be able to recover eassily your
folder/s or file/s.

But remember that snapshot are not technically a real backup.

If the disks fail you will lose data in the case that you have not
performed a complete backup on an external hard disk.


Therefore you have to:

Plan snapshots and perform them daily or weekly AND:

Plan backups at least weekly accordingly to your workflow

In a NAS backup can be easily scheduled. You can perform (and you should)
a backup in more than 1 disk. Meaning that probability of loss of Data
will be spread between the 2 disks as for example.

You should perform also a backup that will be kept outside the
same place of your others backup hard drives/and or NAS, server

This will avoid concentration risk (imagine the case of fire or flood etc)

Having said this, data could be safe with at least 4 hard drives Backups
2 locally and 2 to be kept outside of the actual storage place (a warehouse, another office etc)

You should perform backups on these drives according to the importance
of your workflow.

In a NAS or server backups are often incremental that means that
only changes will be copied, allowing saving of time in the process.

In a NAS or a server backup management will be easier as
it is possible to backup only certain folders etc..



The strategy should be that you have to do backups of your priority
data more frequently than the other type of data.

so it could be:

-------

Snapshots for all (6 days etc)

Top priority data: 2 HD backups every 2-3 day locally (remember that locally
means that you can have easy access to them but they should be kept in different
places (not in the same place or room))
and 2 HD backups to be kept externally every 2 weeks or less (prefereably
one every 1 week and the other one every 2 weeks)
You can also add another 3rd HD every 2-3 days but in a different day than the others


Middle priority: 2 HD backups every 3-5 day locally and 2 HD Backup to be
kept externally (1 every month and 1 every 2 weeks)

Low priority data: 2HD backups every 1 week locally and 2 HD backups to be
kept externally (1 every month and 1 every month and a half)

Doing this you should be pretty covered.
In fact:
In the case of file removal you will have Snapshots
In the case of hardware failure you will have the first HD backup, in the case
of failure of this you will have another one (or another 2 if you deploy another HD)

In the case of missing files or failure (very remote probability) of these last HDs
you will have another 2 HD backups (but with less frequent backups). In this latter case
data loss could become more probable as backup is less frequent.
Anyways, the event that will lead to the use of these HDs could be calculate
as a very rare event (therefore this will be a disaster)


Finally if you really care about your data you can have 2 more HD in which
perform backups every 6 months or every year( but in different months) to be
kept outside of your city /and or country. But remember that data will
be retrievable in a very slow way so make sure you have the other
backups first! (in a sense this will mimick Amazon Glacier..)

As it has been seen, in any case there are still possibilty of data loss. Therefore to
solve this problem you should keep the time between backups the shortest possible
with all the consequences in terms of cost/time management
(as for exapmle that could mean that you should do the backups at least every 2 days
(or depending on you workflow)
both the local ones and the external ones even if for these latter one backup could
be really less feasible in terms of time) (one way to solve is to send backup
over internet to another NAS or server in another place and to place automation
for the scheduling)


Of course this scheme could be simplified treating Middle priority data and the
low one as the same and therefore merging the routines.

Or data could be also not categorized at all and treated as top priority.
In this way you will get a complete backup plan.

the most feasible way is to pay AWS or other service provider..
But if you want to be in full control you have to perform this...
