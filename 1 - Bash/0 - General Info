After you make executable a script with

sudo chmod+x

then you can edit the script and it will run

No necessary to remake executable again!



To run the script just:

./myscript

In the header you must put:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

Running a command through /usr/bin/env has the benefit of looking for whatever the default version of the program is in your current environment.
