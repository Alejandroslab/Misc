when scripting it is useful to save time using the piping

In particulare you can do this:

echo 'Hello!' | tee mynewscript.sh

this will create a file called 'mynewscript.sh' and will fill it with the text after echo command

of course you can just plug in a command 


echo 'ls' | tee mynewscript.sh

and then make it executable

sudo chmod+x mynewscript.sh


Now if you have already that file the text will REPLACE the existing content

to just append you need to put -a option after 'tee'


echo 'ls' | tee -a mynewscript.sh
