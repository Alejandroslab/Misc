Thunderbird change size of fonts

You could create a css file. This only effects Thunderbird. This may seem a little daunting, but it is simple. It requires you to be able to follow instructions, create folders, copy, paste and save files. You do not need to actually write code.
Make Hidden files and folder visible:
	• http://kb.mozillazine.org/Show_hidden_files_and_folders
In Thunderbird:
	• Help > Troubleshooting Information
	• click on 'Open folder' button
a new window opens showing contents of your Profile folder.
	• Close Thunderbird now - this is important.
	• Create new folder and call it chrome note the spelling - use a lower case 'c' . It should be in the same place as the 'Mail' folder. See image below as a guide to show where it should be.
	• open Notepad
usually located under All Programs > Accessories > Notepad
	• Copy all the text between lines below and paste it into the Notepad document.
An example image is below - you can edit to choose size.

/*

* Do not remove the @namespace line -- it's required for correct functioning
 */

@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");

/*
*Make all the default font sizes eg:14 px:
*/

   * { font-size: 14px !important; }


If this proves to be too small you can edit the 14px to say 16px etc
	• Save the document as filename userChrome.css in the chrome folder. Note the spelling all lower case except for the 'C'. See image below.
Restart Thunderbird.
