container data will reside inside docker

this means that if your app usually stores data inside the folder /var/myappfolder

you will not find in the system /var but in the container /var

to access to those files you will need a specific command


sudo docker exec mycontainer_name_or_id cat /var/myappfolder


where mycontainer_name_or_id will be the name of your container (check it with docker ps command. remember is not the name of the image but a name that sometimes is a random name created by your application (like jenkins create random names))
