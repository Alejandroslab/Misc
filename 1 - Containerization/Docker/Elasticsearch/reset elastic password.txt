documentation here is wrong.

first check the name of your container. In my case it is 'es01' 
then put the username you need to reset. In the elasticsearch stack the default user is 'elastic'

Remember that you can run these commands even when the containers (elastic and kibana) are running.
 
('docker exec' will allow to do that)
Therefore you do not need to stop them

To reset the password:

docker exec -ti es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic



finally you may want to recreate the kibana enrollment token. You can do that similarly with:


docker exec -ti es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
