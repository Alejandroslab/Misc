ACCESS TO ROOT
to make things easier change to root:

su


in order to run 'docker' commands without password to be asked each time

DISABLE FIREWALL

then remember to disable your firewalld

systemctl stop firewalld.service

as you will not have possibilty to connect from remote machines





STEPS:

basically you need to install elasticsearch that is the engine and then the front end that is made with kibana

you need to follow some steps


MY SETUP

i will do this with docker on a vm with opensuse. rememeber to increase you ram as this will need at least 2.5 gb of RAM. only elastic with docker will keep 2.3 gb OF RAM BUSY



elasticsearch stack:

docker pull elasticsearch:8.3.3
docker pull kibana:8.3.3
docker pull logstash:8.3.3
