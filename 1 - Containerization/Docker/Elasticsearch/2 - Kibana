proceed now to install kibana

docker pull kibana:8.3.3

now run kibana with the same network of elastic and without the '-d' option



as you have already run elasticsearch without the '-d' option you will need to open another terminal !




docker run --name kibana --net elastic -p 5601:5601 kibana:8.3.3



THIS COMMAND WILL NOT RUN IN BACKGROUND because you need to copy the verification code. In next runs you can just run it in background with the '-d' option

THEREFORE REMEMBER TO NOT STOP THE TERMINAL at least until the first config 
YOU CAN CLOSE THE TERMINAL BUT NOT STOP IT WITH CTRL+C

Kibana can be accessed by browser via http://localhost:5601 or http://host-ip:5601
or clicking on the link that will appear in terminal that has attached a code activation

BY DEFAULT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS TO KIBANA EVEN REMOTELY THAT MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO OPEN WITH LOCALHOST:5601 BUT CAN USE YOUR HOSTNAME FROM A REMOTE MACHINE


It could ask again for an activation code that will appear in terminal. 
Copy that and access to the kibana platform

You can even connect from remote machines (remember to temporarily disable your firewall)

done!


Finally insert your elastic user and password. 
THE DEFAULT USER IS: 'elastic'


The password can be retrieved in the elasticsearch terminal


REMEMBER you can now also close the terminal as kiban will continue running in background (as elasticsearch)!
