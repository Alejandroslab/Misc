you have to use the restart option.

The default restart policy is no.


to use the restart option just:

docker run --restart=always  .....



For the already booted containers use 'docker update' to update the restart policy.

docker update --restart=always 0576df221c0b

where 0576df221c0b is the container id.
The default restart policy is no.


If you try to change the restart policy when the container is not booted up then you will get an error as this must be booted up first with 'docker run'
