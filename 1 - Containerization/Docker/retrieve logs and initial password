you can check the logs (usually the ones that you used to run for the first time your image) and therefore recover also the initial passwords with

sudo docker logs mycontainer_id_or_name


where the 'mycontainer_id_or_name' is the ID or the NAME of the image

The NAME is not the same of the IMAGE
sometimes the NAME is a random name to make it easier to recognize the image (you also have the ID but is way more difficult to remember)

the ID and the random NAME exist because you can have more instances of the same application
