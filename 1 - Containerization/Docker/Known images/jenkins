docker pull jenkins/jenkins:latest



docker run --restart=always -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins

REMEMBER!
if you do not run with the ports like

docker run jenkins

you will not access to jenkis as you did not place
the port



if the run command does not work because 'jenkins:latest' does not work then check the name with

docker images 

copy the repository name (maybe is jenkins/jenkins)

and run:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins

now you will get a password to copy. open the browser coonect to jenkins via:

hostname:8080

and paste it
then you can create an aministrator user

and done 




to check that is running. check java as jenkins is written in java
