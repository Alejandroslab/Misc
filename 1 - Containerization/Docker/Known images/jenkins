docker pull jenkins/jenkins:latest

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins


if the run command does not work because 'jenkins:latest' does not work then check the name with

docker images 

copy the repository name (maybe is jenkins/jenkins)

and run:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins

now you will get a password to copy. open the browser coonect to jenkins via:

hostname:8080

and paste it
then you can create an aministrator user

and done 




to check that is running. check java as jenkins is written in java
