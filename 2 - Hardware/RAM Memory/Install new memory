When you have multiple slots remember to install following the instruction of the manufacturer

Otherwise you will lose time and eventually your pc will not boot (until you do not insert it properly)

Always install DIMM (desktop) or SODIMM (laptop) according to the instructions

You will have to follow the slots order

(like sometimes they are plugged in alternatively jumping a slot
therfore you will plug like: the first and the third slot then the sixth and the eight and so on. Just follow instructions)

If you do not have instruction remmeber that in a possible 8 slots environment you will have

Number assigned   Position from top to bottom
Slot n. 1       first Slot
Slot n. 5       second slot
Slot n. 2       third slot
Slot n. 6       fourth slot

Slot n. 8      fifth slot
Slot n. 4       sixth slot
Slot n. 7       seventh slot
Slot n. 3       eight slot

You will always need to fill the Slot n.1,2 first (that are the first and the third from top)then the 3 and 4 then the 5 and 6
(that are positioned from the top as second and fourth slot)

If you install like you want the system will not boot
