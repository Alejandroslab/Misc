You can plug a x8 card in a x16 slot and viceversa 

No matter if some pin are not connected (the case of a x16 card on a x8 slot)

And overall, no matter if a x8 card is on a x16 slot (some pins will be empty)

It will work anyways!

The only thing is that the less the Pin (that is less the number 4-8-16) and less will be the speed
