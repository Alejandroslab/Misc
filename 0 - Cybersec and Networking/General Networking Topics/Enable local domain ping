case: you want to ping mypc.local

this does not work

in widnows this could occur when tcp/ipv4 protocol is not enabled 
this could happen if you have an adapter inside a bridge and you have forgotten to enable the protocol in the bridge 

go to run->ncpa.cpl 

select your adapter and check that everything is in place 

you must check tcp/ipv4 protocol  is checked
