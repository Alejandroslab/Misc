The “static” host name is the traditional hostname, which can be chosen by the user, and is stored in the /etc/hostname file. 

The “transient” hostname is a dynamic host name maintained by the kernel. It is initialized to the static host name by default, whose value defaults to “localhost”. It can be changed by DHCP or mDNS at runtime. 

The “pretty” hostname is a free-form UTF8 host name for presentation to the user.
