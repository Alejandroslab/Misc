Usually a domestic router is made of different components and has in its inside different systems:

-a router is a modem
- it is also a gateway to guarantee access to external networks
A router and a gateway are essentially the same. The difference stays in the term default gateway. This because in a network you can have multiple routers (“gateways”) 
but only one can be the default that is the one that connect to the external networks

anyways to be more precise a gateway routes differnet type of traffic (not only IP but also ICMP or IPSec)while router manages only similar traffic like Ip protocol


-has installed a DNS server
- has installed a DHCP server

Anyways in your network setup you can separate this things like DNS and DHCP
And install other you like in any device you like and then deactivate them in the router

Anyways this could require diffferent settings for your devices

For example you can install a DNS server on raspberry PI!
In order to use it and to not have any network conflict you just have to deactivate the DNS server on your router and then set all your devices to use your DNS on your raspberry (indicating your raspberry local ip in any device’s network setting or just in the one you like to use it)
