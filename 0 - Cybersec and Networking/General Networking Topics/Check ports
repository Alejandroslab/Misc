run


sudo ss

to check open ports:

sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN


sudo ss -tulpn


Let us run the following to check open TCP and UDP ports using the lsof command:


sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN




The open port doesnâ€™t mean anyone from outside can access those ports



For instance on Linux server we list or dump firewall rules using the following syntax:

sudo iptables -S

IPv6 #

sudo ip6tables -S
