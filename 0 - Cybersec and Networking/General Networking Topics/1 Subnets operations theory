if you connect different devices via WiFi to different subnets there is NO WAY that you will be able to connect the 2 subnets unless you do not configure you router via static routing

you must set a rule via static routing similar:
if a packet arrives to subnet A send it to subnet B

then set it anothe the pther way around (if you do not set it then that will be unidirectional)

therefore:

if a packet arrives to subnet B send it to subnet A
