sudo apt install instaloader
(or you can install with pip3)

instaloader username 

the profile must be public 



To download all pictures and videos of a profile , as well as the profile picture, do

instaloader profile [profile ...]

where profile is the name of a profile you want to download. 

ANYWAYS YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD STORIES OR HIGHLIGHTS AS YOU WILL NEED TO USE --login OPTION THAT IS YOU MUST LOG IN WITH A USERNAME

REMEMBER this command will download all the photos of the profile and will keep also the datestamps!


It can be a nice idea to create a script that runs first sherlock and if it encounters an instagram profile tries to download all with instaloader (of course this will not be possible if the user has a private profile)



MORE INSTRUCTIONS:

Instead of only one profile, you may also specify a list of profiles.

To later update your local copy of that profiles, you may run

instaloader --fast-update profile [profile ...]

If --fast-update is given, Instaloader stops when arriving at the first already-downloaded picture.

Alternatively, you can use --latest-stamps to have Instaloader store the time each profile was last downloaded and only download newer media:

instaloader --latest-stamps -- profile [profile ...]

You can also set it as a cron job to keep analysing profiles.
Instaloader as Cronjob

Instaloader is suitable for running as a cronjob to periodically update your personal Instagram archive. 
The --quiet option disables user interactions and logging of non-error messages. To non-interactively use Instaloader logged-in, create a session file:

instaloader --login=your_username
