In windows 10 you can leave the virtual NIC to 'E1000'
VMXNET3 adapter seem to be not recognized in Windows 10 
In windows 11 if you install vmware tools the adapter VMXNET3 will be recognised
although transfer speed tests with 'iperf3' will get the same results of the adapter 'E1000' (like 2-3 gbps and not 10 gbps)

If you install vmware tools in windows 10 you may get the same results (VMXNET3 will work but not reach 10gbps)(I did not try).

If you use linux (ubuntu, ubuntu based distros, rhel based distros, you get 9-10gbps of transfer speed with 'iperf3' )

Formally you will get a maximum speed of 1gbps and not 10gbps but this is just a formality
as if you use 'iperf3' to inspect speed you will see that the NIC will perform up to 1gbps till 10gbps
