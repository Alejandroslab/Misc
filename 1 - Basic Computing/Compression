Lossy compression is very effective in reducing the size of files, but the integrity of the
information is lost. In other words, the file after compression is not exactly the same as
the original. This type of compression works great for graphics, video, and audio files,
where a small difference in the file is hardly noticeable—.mp3, .mp4, .png, and .jpg areall lossy compression algorithms. If a pixel in a .png file or a single note in an .mp3 file
is changed, your eye or ear is unlikely to notice the difference—though, of course, music
aficionados will say that they can definitely tell the difference between an .mp3 and an
uncompressed .flac file. The strengths of lossy compression are its efficiency and
effectiveness. The compression ratio is very high, meaning that the resulting file is
significantly smaller than the original.

However, lossy compression is unacceptable when you’re sending files or software and
data integrity is crucial. For example, if you are sending a script or document, the
integrity of the original file must be retained when it is decompressed.
