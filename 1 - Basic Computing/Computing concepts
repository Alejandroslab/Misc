Analogic is referred to the "analogy" that the instruments of a measurement performs

like the needle position of a balance to measure weight

Analg representation of data are very hard for computers to be understood

Therefore a digital system has been introduced

All data is represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s.

In Computing to represent numbers has been adopted the binary numnbers system
THis means that only 2 symbols are used (therefore binary)

A single number in a binary number is called a bit (or binary digit)

Bits in sets of eight are called bytes.

It is also used hexadecimal as the binary system could not so easy to remember

The process of translating data into a digital format is known as encoding. When diital data is interpreted it is called decoding

For text to map a character or symbol to a sequence of bits it is used the ASCII system (only for English)

The programs will interpret the binary data accordingly to their use as a sequence of binary can be
seen as text, color or a number or anything else (music, videos, etc)
