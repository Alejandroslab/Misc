If you do not set up a signature your mail will be see as:

text
<end>

if you want to override that just set a proper signature in settings!
test it sending an email

then remember to leave the font as 'Variable Width'
this will allow the receiver the e-mail as it was sent by Outlook (with Calibri font)
basically will use the receiver' settings to see the e-mail
