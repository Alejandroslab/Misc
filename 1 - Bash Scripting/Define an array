array_name=(value1 value2 value3 â€¦ )

IT IS POSSIBLE TO STORE ANY KIND OF DATA INTO THE SAME ARRAY!

to access the array:

echo ${files[1]}

print all the array elements:

echo ${files[*]}

size of the array:

echo ${#files[@]}

ADD AN ELEMENT:

distros=("Ubuntu" "Red Hat" "Fedora")

distros+=("Kali")

DELETE THE NTH VALUE

unset num[2]

this will delete the 2nd value of the array
