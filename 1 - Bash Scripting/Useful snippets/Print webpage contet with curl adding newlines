echo $(curl www.example.com) | sed 's/>/>\n/g'

this will inspect www.example.com, elaborate the output going to new line after it finds the character '>' and finally print the output to stdout (terminal)

in the curl command you can add option '-s' to not view the download progress bar 

after running this if  we know the output is long we should pipe to 'head -n 10' or pipe to 'less' if we want to start at the beginning
