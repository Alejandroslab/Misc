create a txt

touch links.txt

wget -i links.txt

(if there is a space in the name:

wget -i 'these are my links.txt'
)

wget will download all the images.

WHAT IF I WANT TO RENAME THE FILES:
The problem of wget is that it does not provide a coherent naming of the downloaded files

if I use:

wget -o links.txt filename.jpeg

it will not work as every file downloaded will be renamed as filename.jpeg and they will be overwritten.
The final result is just 1 file.

a workaround is a bash script:

touch downloadimages.sh

nano downloadimages.sh

#!/bin/bash
count=1
while read p; do
  wget -O "img${count}.jpg" $p
  count=$((count+1))
done <links.txt

save and close the file

now:
sudo chmod +x downloadimages.sh

_____________________________________________________________


run the script:
./downloadimages.sh

now images will be downloaded with a progressive number in the name.

you have to insert ./ at the beginning otherwise it will not work

remember that if you put an empty line, the script will create a picture anyways.
That picture will be empty.
