If you want to recursively run a command after opening any single subfolder inside a folder then you can use:

find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -name . \) -exec bash -c "cd '{}' && pwd" \;

the command that will be run is the one after '&&'. In this case is 'pwd' but you can run anything you want

The 'cd {}' part will allow to enter in any subdirectory
