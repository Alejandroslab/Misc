We can use the symbol: '>' or '>>' or '>|'

Remember that for the first 2 the output file should already exist.

ls > myfile.txt

the file called 'myfile.txt' shoudl exist as '>' will truncate and add the data

otherwise:

ls >> myfile.txt

will just append the output to the file

If we want to print the command output to a file that still does not exist just run:

ls >| myfile.txt

(no space between >and |)
