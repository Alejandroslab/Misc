$ echo "hello, how are you?" | sed 's/h//'

This will only remove the first occurrence of ‘h’ in the string.

To remove all occurrences of ‘h’ from the string, use the following command:
$ echo "hello, how are you?" | sed 's/h//g'



To remove the first and last character from the string “hello, how are you?” the command would be:
echo "hello, how are you?" | sed 's/^.//;s/.$//'
