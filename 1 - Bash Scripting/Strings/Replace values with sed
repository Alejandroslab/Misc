Use Stream EDitor (sed) as follows:
sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt

I am going to use s/ for substitute the found expression foo with bar as follows:
sed 's/foo/bar/g' hello.txt

the '/g' is needed to change it along all the file


ISSUES:

replace http with https will need a + as the command otherwise will be misleaded because of the '/'

sed 's+http://+https://www.cyberciti.biz+g' input.txt
