To make a bash script executable

First create the script with extention '.sh'

vim myscript.sh

to run it you can use 'sh'

sh myscript.sh

careful with this some parts (like the 'infinite' for loop) will not work

in this case you will need to make it executable




then make it exectuable with:

sudo chmod +x myscript.sh

finally you can run the script:
./myscript.sh

REMEMBER! If you want to change your script you do not need to run again:
sudo chmod +x ....
Just change it and run it!
Have fun
