to create a csv with a list of numbers one per line:

seq 1 100 > mycount.csv

this will create a csv with a sequence of numbers startign from 1 to 100

REMEMBER! you need to separate with a space between the operator '>' otherwise the commadn will not work

e.g. this WILL NOT create anything:

seq 1 100>mycount.csv
