array_name=(value1 value2 value3 â€¦ )

IT IS POSSIBLE TO STORE ANY KIND OF DATA INTO THE SAME ARRAY!

to access the array:

echo ${files[1]}



array=()	create an empty array with declaring is valid
array=(1 6 3)	Initialize array with numbers
array=(one two three)	Initialize array with string
array=(one two 1)	Initialize array with mixed data


An array can be defined as a collection of similar type of elements. Unlike most of the programming languages, arrays in bash scripting need not be the collection of similar elements. Since Bash does not discriminate the string from a number, an array may contain both strings and numbers.
