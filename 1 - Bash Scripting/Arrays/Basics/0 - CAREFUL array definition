You define an array with brackets always

myarray=(...)

if you do not put = and the brackets that will not be recognized as an array


when you define an array you must be very careful with the '='
you must follow the empty space convention

this will work:
array1=( $( ls . ) )

this will not work:
array1 = ( $( ls . ) )

you will get unexpected token error '('

ARRAYS STARTS FROM 1 and not 0
