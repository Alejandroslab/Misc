myvar="string1 string2 string3"



# Redefine myvar to myarray using parenthesis
myarray=($myvar)

Alternatively
# Storing as array into myarray
read -a myarray <<< $myvar

if we have a delimiter:

myvar="string1,string2,string3"

# Here comma is our delimiter value
IFS="," read -a myarray <<< $myvar

or:

myvar="string1,string2,string3"

# Here comma is our delimiter value
IFS="," read -a myarray <<< $myvar
