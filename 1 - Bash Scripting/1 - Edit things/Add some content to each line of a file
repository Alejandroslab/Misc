let's suppose we have a myfile.txt with a text on each line:

1
2
3
..


this will edit the file "in place" 
this means that the file will be overwritten

sed -i s/$/" this is the text to add"/ myfile.txt

i have added a space inside the quotes as otherwise you will get the text attached to the previous one

the result will be:

1 this is the text to add
2 this is the text to add
3 this is the text to add
..
