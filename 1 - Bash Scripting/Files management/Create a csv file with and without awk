you can create a csv file as the ouptof of a command like:

ls -lah > myfiles.csv

you can also create a csv with a specified delimiter with awk:

ls -lah | awk '{print $5,$9}' OFS=";" > myfileslist.csv

where OFS indicate the delimiter

This will print the columsn 5 and 9 (not the range)



_______________
If we want to print all the columns then just run:

ls -lah | awk '{print $0}' OFS=";" > myfileslist.csv

_______________
to print a range:

ls -lah | awk -v f=4 -v t=8 '{for(i=f;i<=t;i++) printf("%s%s",$i,(i==t)?"\n":OFS=";")}'

_______________________
This is useful when you want to open the file in excel
If you open directly with excel, Excel will separate the columns automatically

REMEMBER! You must indicate the right delimiter ! For US excel the delimiter is always the comma therefore
OFS will become OFS=","
In Italian usually the Excel delimiter is ';' therefore OFS will be OFS=";"

Anyways you can also leave OFS blank like 'OFS' without sepcifing anythign
