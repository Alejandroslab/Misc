You cannot create an xlsx file
You can create an xls file (old format)
anyways whenervr you open a message of format and extension mismatch will appear (even if you can actually open the file)

therefore it is suggested just to use the csv with the right delimiter and leave Excel doing the proper split of the data opening the csv.

You can also add tables directly on you csv and then save it in xlsx file in Windwos
