You do not need to add a number to 'exit'
They are generally added just for reference when scripting

Anyways bash recognises exit codes

you can type: echo $?
after running a command and you will get '0' when the command returns the right output and no error have been arised. 

exit 0 is referred to Success
exit 1 is general errors
exit 2 is misuse of shell builtins
