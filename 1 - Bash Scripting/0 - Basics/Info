In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs.
In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI)
or graphical user interface (GUI),
depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
It is the high level way to interact with a machine

Command-line shells are bash for Unix or zsh (pronunciation 'zeesh'), zsh for MacOs since Catalina
and Command Prompt (or cmd) for Windows or PowerShell

Graphical shells are built on top of a windowing system:
FileExplorer for Windows, Finder for Mac, GNOME, KDE for Linux
