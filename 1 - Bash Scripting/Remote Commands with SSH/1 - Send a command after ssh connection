If you want to send a command immediately after having logged in via ssh just:

ssh server_user@server $HOST ls; pwd

This will run the commands 'ls' and 'pwd' immediately after having successfully logged in via ssh
(after you have typed the password)


You can also send like this

ssh systemsboy@rhost.systemsboy.edu 'ls -l; ps -aux; whoami'
