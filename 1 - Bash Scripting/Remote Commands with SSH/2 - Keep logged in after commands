if you run the previous commands they will run but afterwards the
SSH connection will automatically be closed

To avoid this behaviour just use this loophole:


ssh user@host  -t 'bash -l -c "ls;bash"'

In this way bash will be invoked after the command 'ls'

(This does not work if you use 'screens' the terminal windows manager)

Another reasonable way to do this (even if I have not tested it):

ssh user@host -t 'ls; exec $SHELL -l'
