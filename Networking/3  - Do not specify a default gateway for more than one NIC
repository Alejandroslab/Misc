When a destination IP address does not fall within the subnet of any NIC, 

then a default gateway is used to relay packets to the outside network. 

If multiple default gateways exist, then packets may be routed to the wrong outside network, causing them to be undeliverable. 

In most cases, you should be able to address all computers attached to a network interface on the same private subnet, 

and leave the default gateway blank for that interface. 


Typically only one NIC with a gateway to the internet or corporate network should have a default gateway address specified.
