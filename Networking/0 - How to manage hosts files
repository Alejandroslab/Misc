you can use your hosts files to avoid connection to some site 

just remember that:

127.0.0.1 google.com

first you need the IP where the website will be redirected and then the webiste or ip that you want to redirect 

in this case if you redirect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) the page will not work as will redirect to your own machine. 

DO NOT PLACE BEFORE THE IP TO REDIRECT AND THEN THE DESTINATION AS THIS WILL NOT WORK
