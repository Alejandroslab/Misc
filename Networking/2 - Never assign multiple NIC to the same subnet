A subnet is 192...or 172... or 10....


An ip address range is : 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.255

If I use the same subnet for different NICs the system may make conflicts 

Using multiple NICs on the same subnet is the #1 cause of connectivity issues on multi-NIC systems. 

While some OSs may be able to gracefully handle the presence of multiple NICs on one subnet, 

others may mistakenly attempt to send packets out of the wrong interface. 

You can remedy this issue by statically assigning one NIC (and the other networked computers attached to that NIC) 

to the 192.168.x.x range with subnet mask 255.255.0.0, 

and another NIC on the 10.0.x.x range with subnet mask 255.255.0.0. 


Note that this is just one possible configuration, any combination of two or more different subnets will work. 

It is recommended that you use one of the designated private IP address ranges to avoid conflicts with public servers on the internet.


One of the most common scenarios resulting in multiple NICs being assigned to the same subnet is when both a wired and wireless interface 

are used to connect to the same network. 


Once again, while some OSs may handle this case gracefully, 

it is a best practice to either configure the wired and wireless networks to exist on different subnets 

or to disable one network interface when using the other.
