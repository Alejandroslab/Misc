docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.3.3

create a docker network for elastic and for kibana (the docker netowrk must be the same)


docker network create elastic


then run it


docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.3.3

You might need to scroll back a bit in the terminal to view the password and enrollment token.

Copy the generated password and enrollment token and save them in a secure location. These values are shown only when you start Elasticsearch for the first time.


If you need to reset the password for the elastic user or other built-in users, run the elasticsearch-reset-password tool. This tool is available in the Elasticsearch /bin directory of the Docker container. For example:

docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password
