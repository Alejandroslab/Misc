first let's install elasticsearch

Downoload from registry

docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.3.3

now create a docker network for elastic and for kibana (the docker netowrk will be the same for both)


docker network create elastic


then run it


docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.3.3


remeber to change the 'tag' accordingly. the tag is the version usually. in this case is 8.3.3

THIS COMMAND WILL NOT RUN IN BACKGROUDN because you need to copy the enrollment token in kibana. In next runs you can just run it in background with the '-d' option


You might need to scroll back a bit in the terminal to view the password and enrollment token.

Copy the generated password and enrollment token and save them in a secure location. These values are shown only when you start Elasticsearch for the first time.
the default user will be 'elastic'

Now you will not be able to check if it is working properly. If you want to do that you need to download a certificate as explained in the website and then check it with a curl command and the certificate from your remote machine

anyways you can check everything is working after installing kibana 

If you need to reset the password for the elastic user or other built-in users, run the elasticsearch-reset-password tool. This tool is available in the Elasticsearch /bin directory of the Docker container. For example:

docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password
