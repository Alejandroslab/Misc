proceed now to install kibana

docker pull kibana:8.3.3

now run kibana with the same network of elastic and without the '-d' option

docker run --name kibana --net somenetwork -p 5601:5601 kibana:8.3.3

THIS COMMAND WILL NOT RUN IN BACKGROUND because you need to copy the verification code. In next runs you can just run it in background with the '-d' option


Kibana can be accessed by browser via http://localhost:5601 or http://host-ip:5601
You can even connect from remote machines (remember to temporarily disable your firewall)

done!
