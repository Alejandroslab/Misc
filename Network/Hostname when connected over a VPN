when you are connected to a VPN provider such as NordVPN etc, then
you cannot access to your local resources with your hostnames

to link your hostnames to your local resources (ip) you can specify them in the hosts
file

in mac as in linux you will find it here:

/etc/hosts

add your ip and hostname like

192.168.1.10 mypc

save and exit and immediately the hostname will be recognized
