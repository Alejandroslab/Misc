You may have purchasen a switch that has some 10gbps ports

Rememeber that these ports can work as a normal 1 gbps port

This means that you can connect the 10gbps calbe to any other switch and router as
when creating a normal connection between 1gbps ports

This because 10gbps port usually are compatible with the previous standards.

I have tested this setup with a switch with SFP+ cables and it worked!
