Open the app go to Workspace -> Clone 

For the first time click on 'Set credentials' 
You need to insert email, the token code

and the email for reference

(remember to get the token code go to github settings> developer settings> personal access tokens> tokens (classic)  create a new token 

and check only 'repo'. finally copy the code)


after typing in username, token and email click ok

now go to Menu>Navigation>Workspace

then click on Clone

finally you must (sigh..) type in the URL with https

you must copy it from github and finally click on clone

then you can make edits, commit and push even if it is a bit slow (when compared with WorkingCopy (iOS)

you must first commit, wait and then click again to make the push.. (not the best solution possible but it seems that is the only app on android for github)
