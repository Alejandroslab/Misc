When you have multiple tasks some commands may fail as the command will not work.

To continue performing the other tasks and indicate the one that has failed with 'ignored' at the 'PLAY RECAP' 

You can use the option 'ignore_errors: true' on any command



    - name: Check systemctl ufw
      shell:
          "sudo systemctl status ufw"
      register: system1
      changed_when: false
      become: true
      ignore_errors: true
      tags: system1

    - debug: msg="{{system1.stdout_lines}}"


    - name: Check docker running images
      shell:
          "sudo docker ps"
      register: docker1
      changed_when: false
      become: true
      ignore_errors: true
      tags: docker1

    - debug: msg="{{docker1.stdout_lines}}"


in these tasks if the first one will fail like the 'ufw' does not exist or is not installed on a system then will continue
the next one that is 'sudo docker ps'

If we do not place 'ignore_errors:true' then the playbook will stop for the machine that fails and will not perform the other tasks
