  - name: My Playbook
    #define the hosts that are defined in the inventory.yaml
    hosts: datacenter1
    tasks:

    - name: Check Date with Shell command
      shell:
         "date"
      register: datecmd
      changed_when: false
      tags: datecmd
      
    - debug: msg="{{datecmd.stdout}}"
    
    
    
    With 'shell' you may put the command between double quotes " ".
    
    with 'register' you will store the output with a name. in this case with a variable called 'datecmd'
    
    'changed_when: false' allows to omit the 'changed' message
    
    
    'debug: msg="{{datecmd.stdout}}"' allows to print the output 
    You will just print the variable 'datecmd' that you have previously registered. 
    
    
    Finally for some commands you may want to use '.stdout_lines'
    As the common '.stdout' will not list properly the files with some commands like 'ls':
    
    - name: List home files
      shell:
          "ls -lah"
      register: lsout
      changed_when: false
      tags: lsout

    - debug: msg="{{lsout.stdout_lines}}"
