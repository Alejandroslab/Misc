    tasks:

    - name: Check Date with Shell command
      shell:
         "date"
      register: datecmd
      changed_when: false
      tags: datecmd
      
    - debug: msg="{{datecmd.stdout}}"
    
    
    
    With 'shell' you may put the command between double quotes " ".
    
    with 'register' you will store the output with a name. in this case with a variable called 'datecmd'
    
    'changed_when: false' allows to omit the 'changed' message
    
    
    'debug: msg="{{datecmd.stdout}}"' allows to print the output 
    You will just print the variable 'datecmd' that you have previously registered.
