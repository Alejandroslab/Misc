   to use sudo you must consider first that the nodes must have the same password then 
   
   do 2 things:
   
   first thing to do is to change the running playbook command adding an option that is '-K'
   
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml playbook.yaml -K

   
  then in the playbook :
  
  
  
 -name: My Playbook
    #define the hosts that are defined in the inventory.yaml
    hosts: datacenter1
    tasks:
  
    - name: Check docker running images
        shell:
            "sudo docker ps"
        register: docker1
        changed_when: false
        become: true
        tags: docker1

      - debug: msg="{{docker1.stdout_lines}}"

    
 
    then we must add the 'become: true'
    
    done!
