You can add an host to /etc/hosts or
you can create anywhere a file called 

inventory.yaml


in wich you must place this code:



virtualmachines:
  hosts:
    vm01:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
    vm02:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.51
    vm03:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.52


you can delete vm02 and vm03 even with '#' (that is placing comment

now check the inventory with:

ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --list

and you can also ping it.
if everythins is green you are ok


ansible virtualmachines -m ping -i inventory.yaml
