You can add an host to /etc/hosts or
you can create anywhere a file called 

inventory.yaml


in wich you must place this code:



virtualmachines:
  hosts:
    vm01:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
    vm02:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.51
    vm03:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.52

The first line is the name of the pool of nodes. in this case is 'virtualmachines'

Then you specify the nodes. In this case are called 'vm01', 'vm02', 'vm03'
you can delete vm02 and vm03 even with '#' (that is placing a comment)

You can also change it with any name you want. Be sure to not add any squared brackets '['']'
Finally add the ips or just use the hostnames.


Now check the inventory with:

ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --list

and you can also ping it.
if everythins is green you are ok


ansible virtualmachines -m ping -i inventory.yaml
