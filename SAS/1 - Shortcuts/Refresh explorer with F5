It happens that you need to refresh your Explorer

You may want to do that with F5

In sas in your editor you can run:

dm "next explorer; refresh";

You can transpose this code to your 'keys'

got to the top bar and search 'keys'

the keys column will appear

Now in any of the shortcuts provided we can type in a SAS command


Go to F5 and type:

next explorer; refresh
(you do not need to put the last semicolumn )
done (to test it you do not need to exit 'keys' column)
