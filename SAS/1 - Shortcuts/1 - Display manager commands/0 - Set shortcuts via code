dm "keydef F12 'cle log; cle output; submit'";

RUn this on Sas editor (locally not remotely)

This will set the shortuct between quote '' with the key 'F12'

You can set any particular shortcut with commands. The only limit is that you must set a shortcut not very common like F1, F2,or shift + f2 etc as these are usually reserved to the OS and SAS will not run them

wpgm is the enhanced editor
