kubeadm allows you to pass a KubeletConfiguration structure during kubeadm init. This KubeletConfiguration can include the cgroupDriver field which controls the cgroup driver of the kubelet.


Note: In v1.22, if the user is not setting the cgroupDriver field under KubeletConfiguration, kubeadm will default it to systemd.

(I WILL PASS THIS STEP!)

A minimal example of configuring the field explicitly:

# kubeadm-config.yaml
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kubernetesVersion: v1.21.0
---
kind: KubeletConfiguration
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
cgroupDriver: systemd

Such a configuration file can then be passed to the kubeadm command:

kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml

Note:

Kubeadm uses the same KubeletConfiguration for all nodes in the cluster. The KubeletConfiguration is stored in a ConfigMap object under the kube-system namespace.

Executing the sub commands init, join and upgrade would result in kubeadm writing the KubeletConfiguration as a file under /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml and passing it to the local node kubelet.
