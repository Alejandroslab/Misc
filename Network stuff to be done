Remmeber to implement
network segmentation (that means divide the devices
in different subnets and set iptables command in order to
make rules to who can have access to the internet or to
the router etc..)

in this way you will build a good network organisation

segmentation is also the concept behind the DMZ
that is the demilitarized zone, a sort of buffer
open to the internet that stays outside the main network
